🎓 Student Performance Index – Machine Learning & Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing student academic data to identify the key factors influencing their performance and to build a predictive model for estimating student scores. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and Linear Regression, the project offers actionable insights that can help educators and institutions make data-driven decisions.

🔍 Project Objectives
Understand and explore the student dataset to uncover performance trends.

Visualize relationships between student attributes (like study time, parental background, etc.) and their scores.

Build a Student Performance Index using Linear Regression to predict academic outcomes.

Evaluate the effectiveness of the model using standard regression metrics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for the project.

Pandas: For data wrangling and manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model (Linear Regression).

NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

📊 Key Steps in the Workflow
Data Loading & Cleaning: Loaded and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained insights into score distributions, gender-based differences, and correlation patterns.

Feature Engineering: Selected key input features for modeling student performance.

Model Building: Applied Linear Regression to predict final scores.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.

✅ Outcomes
Developed a predictive model to estimate student scores with reasonable accuracy.

Identified influential features such as study time, parental education, and test preparation.

Provided visual and statistical insights that highlight the importance of early intervention and personalized learning strategies.
